# DNS-Cache-Posioning
The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as a critical component of internet infrastructure, facilitating the translation of domain names to IP addresses. However, DNS security remains a pressing concern due to various malicious activities targeting its vulnerabilities. 

#
This report focuses on DNS cache poisoning, an attack that aims to manipulate the DNS resolution process, diverting legitimate requests to unintended destinations. To comprehensively explore DNS cache poisoning, this study begins with an examination of foundational knowledge, terminology, and the setup of virtual environments and tools. Subsequently, a sequence of attacks is conducted, including host file poisoning, DNS spoofing, and ultimately, DNS cache poisoning, highlighting the motivations behind attackersâ€™ preference for this method. Mitigation measures and encountered challenges during the project setup are also discussed. By investigating these aspects, this report enhances understanding of DNS cache poisoning, its significance as an attack vector, and the need for robust security measures to safeguard the DNS infrastructure.
